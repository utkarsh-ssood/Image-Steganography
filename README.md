# Image-Steganography

## Overview

This project focuses on securely hiding a secret message within an image using encryption techniques. The user provides a secret message and a password, and the program encrypts the message within the image. Later, the user can decrypt the message using the provided password.

## Features

- **Image Encryption:** Hide a secret message within an image.
- **Password Authentication:** Ensure security with password-based authentication.
- **Customizable:** Easily customize the code for different use cases.

## Project Structure

- **`img1.jpg`:** Sample image for encryption.
- **`encryptedimg.jpg`:** Output file with the encrypted message.
- **`main.py`:** Python script containing the image encryption and decryption code.
- **`README.md`:** Project documentation.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-encryption-project.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd image-encryption-project
3. **Run the main script: **
   ```bash
   python encripew.py

## Dependencies
This project relies on the following dependencies:

OpenCV: Open Source Computer Vision Library.

## Usage
Run the script and follow the prompts to input the secret message and password.
The encrypted image will be saved as encryptedimg.jpg.
To decrypt the message, run the script again and provide the correct password.
